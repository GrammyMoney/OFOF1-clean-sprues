# How to assemble an OFOF1 (regular version)

## Step 1: Tools

Here is the bare minimum of what you will need:
 - Soldering iron
 - Solder
 - Flush cutters
 - Hobby knife
 - 3mm hex key

A multimeter is not technically required but will make your life easier

## Step 2: Parts

Here are all the parts that you will need (the packing list shows what I pack in the DIY kits I sell and includes a few spares of button parts, hotswap sockets, hardware, etc.)

## Step 3: Buttons

### 3.1:

Break the button panels apart and sort the top housings, bottom housings, and keycaps

### 3.2:

Use the flush cutters and/or the hobby knife to clip/cut the remaining connecting bits from the button parts

### 3.3: 

Insert a top housing through the hole in the top panel

### 3.4: 

Put an o-ring over the protruding portion of the top housing

### 3.5:

Screw the bottom housing onto the threads of the top housing until it is snug (not overly tight) and the square hole is parallel with the top panel

### 3.6:

Repeat for the remaining 19 buttons.  When finished it should look like this:

### 3.7

Insert switches into all the housings as shown - make sure the pins are aligned towards the bottom of the panel to fit with the hotswap sockets on the OF1 PCB

Do not put keycaps on yet
